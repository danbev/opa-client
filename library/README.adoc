# OPA Client

Client intended to work with an OPA server over HTTP(S).

## Policy Querying

Initial work is towards policy querying (using the *Data API*), not policy or document management within an OPA server.

## Building

Currently integration tests use (a fork of) `testcontainers` crate, which requires Docker or Podman to be running.
The setup as it stands today is through using Unix domain sockets.
If using some non-default socket location, `DOCKER_SOCKET` environment variable should be set, pointing to the control endpoint for Docker or Podman.
For podman on Linux this can be configured by running the
